### Simplified Logic from Chainlit Application

1. **Enquiry Type Selection:**
   - Loan from a private company to a shareholder or associate (Loan logic applies)
   - Payment from a private company to a shareholder or associate (Payment logic applies)
   - Debt owed by a shareholder or associate to a private company (Debt logic applies)

2. **Loan Logic:**
   - If loan is fully repaid by lodgment day => No dividend under Division 7A.
   - If not repaid:
     - Was the loan made during winding-up?:
       - If yes, and within the same year => No dividend.
       - If yes, but after specified year, and fully repaid later => No dividend.
       - Otherwise => Dividend applies.
     - Was the loan made in ordinary business terms?:
       - If yes => No dividend.
       - Otherwise:
         - Loan solely for acquiring qualifying shares?:
           - If yes => No dividend.
           - Otherwise:
             - Included in assessable income? => No dividend.
             - Specifically excluded from assessable income? => No dividend.
             - Written loan agreement before lodgment day?:
               - If yes, with compliant interest rate => No dividend.
               - Otherwise => Dividend.

3. **Payment Logic:**
   - If payment to shareholder as employee => No dividend.
   - If not, was payment for genuine debt? => No dividend.
   - Included in assessable income? => No dividend.
   - Specifically excluded from assessable income? => No dividend.
   - Distribution during winding-up? => No dividend.
   - Converted to loan? => No dividend.
   - Otherwise => Dividend.

4. **Debt Logic:**
   - Was the debt obligation released or waived?:
     - If yes => Dividend (Debt forgiven).
   - Agreement to cease obligation without obligation?:
     - If yes => Dividend (Debt forgiven).
   - Subscription for shares to discharge debt?:
     - If yes => Dividend (Debt forgiven).
   - Debt parking arrangement?:
     - If yes => Dividend (Debt forgiven).
   - Company no longer insisting on repayment?:
     - If yes => Dividend (Debt forgiven).
     - Otherwise => No dividend.

### Notes:
- Decision paths are fully accounted for with `Yes` or `No` answers leading to the next logical step.
- For every scenario, specific actions lead to either a dividend or no dividend declaration.
